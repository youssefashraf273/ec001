Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,
 followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.
  After AlphaGo defeated a professional Go player in 2015, artificial intelligence once again attracted widespread global attention. For most of its history,
  AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each other. These sub-fields are based on technical considerations,
  such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks)
  , or deep philosophical differences. Sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).
